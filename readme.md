Virtual Reality mod for Quake 3 Arena on the PC. At close range it's best to aim using freeaim. At long range it's best to aim using ironsights. When you use ironsights while moving very fast your velocity influences the offset of the weapon relative to the screen, so you have to guesstimate the offset while moving. Angular velocity and accelration also influences the weapon position.
